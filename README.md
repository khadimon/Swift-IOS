Experienced with SwiftUI 
Researched on how to import Spotify data


Still need to do:
- Import Spotify API
- Spotify account - link
  - [X] - do research on music databases/creating APIs
  - [X] - create Spotify Developers account
  - [ ] - create API
     - NOTE: I started applying WebAPI, but I couldn't figure out the redirect URI yet. I'll keep working on it.
- Login page (if needed)
     - NOTE: I had to create SDK, but it required iPhone and not a simulation to check the results 

Week 10 Update:
- [X] - made some buttons functional
- [X] - tried to implement SpotifyAPI
