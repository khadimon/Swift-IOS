## Notes

I missed the class, and i was struggling with the assigment. However, yesterday i decided to re-learn the topic, so i rewatched the lecture, and finished the lab. I got it! However, i started the process late, which is why my 72 hours are about to expire. I'm submitting what code i had, and some screenshots of my Lab code to show that i did some work. I'll try to finish it up and catch up before next class. College midterms have already started for me too, so it has been quite hectic. I do realize that is my responsibility to allocate time for studying this class, finish homework and follow the rules, so i apologize!
