Experienced with SwiftUI 
Researched on how to import Spotify data


Still need to do:
- Import Spotify API
- Spotify account - link
  [X] - did research
  [X] - created Spotify Developers account
  [ ] - create API
      NOTE: i started applying WebAPI, but I couldn't figure out the redirect URI yet. I'll keep working on it.
- [ ] - Login page (if needed)
      NOTE: I had to create SDK, which required iPhone to check if program works and not a simulation 

Week 10 Update:
[X] - made some buttons functional
[X] - tried to implement SpotifyAPI
